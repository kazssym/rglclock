>> DESCRIPTION

rglclock is a rotating 3D clock program using Mesa/OpenGL and GTK+.

rglclock just starts with a stationary clock like traditional clock
programs, but by dragging within the clock window, you can start the
clock rotating in the direction you drag.  Any additional drag changes
the direction of the rotation.  The longer you drag, the faster the
clock rotates.

>> REQUIREMENTS

Building rglclock requires a recent C++ compiler, GTK 1.2, and Mesa or
OpenGL libraries.

* C++ compiler

rglclock is written in C++.  The compiler must support exception
handling.  EGCS 1.1 and GCC 2.95 should work, and actually were used
for development.  GCC 2.8.* may work but is not tested.  GCC 2.7.*
does not work.

* GTK+ 1.2

rglclock uses GTK+ 1.2 for its user interface.

* Mesa or OpenGL

rglclock uses either Mesa or OpenGL for 3D rendering.  The configure
script always prefers OpenGL to Mesa, as OpenGL is supposed to be
faster.

* libxml (optional)

rglclock uses libxml to save runtime options.  If it is not available
at configure time, all options' settings will be transient.

>> INSTALL

This package uses a configure script.  Common instructions
for compiling and installing the program are described in
INSTALL file in this directory.
